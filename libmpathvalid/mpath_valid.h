 * DESCRIPTION:

 * 	points to an array of wwids, that were returned from previous
 * 	calls to mpathvalid_is_path(). These are wwids of existing
 * 	devices that are or potentially are claimed by device-mapper
 * 	multipath. path_wwids is used with the MPATH_SMART claim mode,
 *	to claim devices when another device with the same wwid exists.
 * 	nr_paths must either be set to the number of elements of
 * 	path_wwids, or 0, if path_wwids is NULL.
 * @name: The kernel name of the device. input argument
 * @mode: the find_multipaths claim mode (mpath_valid_mode). input argument
 * @wwid: address of a pointer to the path wwid, or NULL. Output argument.

 * @path_wwids: Array of pointers to path wwids, or NULL. input argument
 * @nr_paths: number of elements in path_wwids array. input argument.
 *
 * RETURNS: device claim result (mpath_valid_result)
 * 	    Also sets *wwid if wwid is not NULL, and the claim result is
